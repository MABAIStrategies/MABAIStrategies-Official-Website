## Baseline

Audit every trigger, document owners, and ensure service accounts have least-privilege access.

## Build

Create opinionated templates for Docs, Sheets, and Slides so downstream automations stay consistent. Pair each Zapier workflow with automated testing where possible.

## Operate

Add observability: Slack alerts, BigQuery logs, and a weekly hygiene review. When finance or HR trusts the audit log, you can scale automation into sensitive processes.

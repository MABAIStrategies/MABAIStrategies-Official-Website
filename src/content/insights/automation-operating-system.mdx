## Why operations need an OS

B2B teams hit a ceiling when every workflow is a bespoke spreadsheet. An automation OS clarifies **ownership**, **data flows**, and **guardrails** so AI can contribute without chaos.

## Core layers

1. **Instrumentation** – capture the signals that prove value.
2. **Automation fabric** – orchestrate Zapier, agents, and custom code behind a single change log.
3. **Human in the loop** – define when people review, override, or escalate.

## Activation playbook

Start with the revenue moments that matter: renewals, onboarding, compliance. Map the steps, remove noise, then let AI assist. Iterate weekly, and publish updates so leadership trusts the system.

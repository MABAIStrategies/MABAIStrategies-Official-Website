## Pilot scope

Keep the scope narrow enough that you can observe every message an agent sends. We pair each agent with a human owner and publish an escalation tree before day one.

## Telemetry

Traceability is the unlock. Instrument every tool call, add structured feedback, and require weekly reviews with the business owner. When telemetry is clear, trust follows.

## Success metrics

* Cycle time reduction
* Human hours reclaimed
* Error rate delta

Prove two of the three and your program earns more budget.
